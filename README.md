# Hi there I'm Spoekle!

I'm a sudent living in the Netherlands and I like to do some coding in my spare time. I'm still learning a lot, but have become quite proficient in frontend development.

## Some projects that I have been working on:
- [Personal Website](https://spoekle.com)
This website is uses for various tools, hosting services and more!
- [Country Comparer](https://github.com/Spoekle/country-compare)
Country Comparer is a tool where you can compare the Country of a Beatleader player to the Country of their ScoreSaber account.
